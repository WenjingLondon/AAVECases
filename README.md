This repository is based on an in-depth study of the Aave Protocol and demonstrates several practical case studies aimed at deepening the understanding of its mechanisms. 
The exercises are designed to explore how Aaveâ€™s core data and logic can be leveraged for building more effective strategies, particularly for yield aggregator applications.

Included Case Studies:
* #getAaveAssetData.js :  Retrieve key asset data such as APY, LTV, and liquidation threshold. Token assets include: DAI, USDC, WBTC.

* Simulate a walletâ€™s Supply & Borrow state for risk analysis

* Simulate asset deposits and calculate projected 30-day earnings (Compound interest logic)

* Implement a minimal strategy contract that connects to Aave, automates deposits, and fetches yield

* Combine multiple Aave token strategies and construct a weighted return analysis function

### ðŸ”— Testing Network Setup

This project uses Alchemy's Ethereum Mainnet fork feature for local testing:

- Fork Source: Ethereum Mainnet
- RPC Provider: [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- Local testing is conducted via Hardhat's `forking` functionality, which simulates the mainnet state in a local development environment.
- To run the local forked node (requires your own Alchemy API key stored in `.env`):

```bash
npx hardhat node --fork https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${ALCHEMY_API_KEY}
